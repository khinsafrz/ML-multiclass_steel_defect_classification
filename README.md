Machine learning - multiclass classification

The manual inspection methods used for defect detection in steel are time-consuming and prone to human error, highlighting the need for automated systems. Machine learning algorithms are effective to accurately identifying and classifying defects in steel surfaces. 
The objective of this experiment is to evaluate different machine learning models and find the best model for steel defect detections. 
The Faulty Steel Plates dataset from Kaggle was used and the project was done using Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method was employed to remove outliers. Decision Tree was then used for features selection. 
Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-nearest neighbours (KNN) were applied as machine learning models.
Random Forest emerges as the most effective machine learning model for steel defect detection with an accuracy of 0.825 and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) score of 0.975.
